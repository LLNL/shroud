Python Previous Work
====================

There a several available tools to creating a Python interface to a C or C++ library.

.. https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html
   https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3118/  Revising the buffer protocol
   https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html

Ctypes
------

* http://docs.python.org/lib/module-ctypes.html

Pros
^^^^

* No need for compiler.

Cons
^^^^

* Difficult wrapping C++ due to mangling and object ABI.

I ran Cython (a Python->C converter) on the previous benchmark, and it
runs in exactly the same amount of time: 2.11s. I wrote a simplified C
extension in 36 lines compared to Cython's 3600, and it too runs in
2.11s.
