Shroud
======

**Shroud** is a tool for creating a Fortran or Python interface to a C
or C++ library.  It can also create a C API for a C++ library.

The user creates a YAML file with the C/C++ declarations to be wrapped
along with some annotations to provide semantic information and code
generation options.  **Shroud** produces a wrapper for the library.
The generated code is highly-readable and intended to be similar to code
that would be hand-written to create the bindings.

*verb*
    1. wrap or dress (a body) in a shroud for burial.
    2. cover or envelop so as to conceal from view.
