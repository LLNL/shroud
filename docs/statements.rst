Statements
==========

Shroud can be thought of as a fancy macro processor.
The statement data structure is used to define code that should be
used to create the wrapper.
Combinations of language, type and attributes are used to select
a statement entry.


.. base - must be single name.
          Applied after all of the others mixins as parent of Scope.
          Cannot also have a *mixin* field.
          Useful to define a group that varies slightly
          such as pointer vs reference argument.

.. mixin - list of single names, no alternative allowed such as allocatable/pointer
           must not contain 'alias', 'append' or 'base'
           List fields from the mixin group will be appended to the group
           being defined.
           Non-lists are assigned.
           Dictionaries are recursively appended (f_module).

.. append - applied after mixins as a sort of one-off mixin to append to fields.
      f_post_call is defined by the mixins but need to add one more line.
      Cannot be used in a mixin.

        name="f_out_string_**_cdesc_allocatable",
        mixin=[
            "f_mixin_out_array_cdesc",
            "f_mixin_out_array_cdesc_allocatable",
        ],
        append=dict(
            f_post_call=[
                "call {f_helper_array_string_allocatable}({f_var_alloc}, {f_var_cdesc})",
            ],
        ),
        f_post_call [ ]      # will replace the value instead of appending.

        or maybe with {copy_allocate} in the mixin.

        fmtdict:
           copy_allocate: "call {f_helper_array_string_allocatable}({f_var_alloc}, {f_var_cdesc})"
   

.. fmtdict - A dictionary to replace default values

        name: f_function_char_*_cfi_arg
        base: f_function_char_*_cfi_copy
        fmtdict:
            f_var: "{F_string_result_as_arg}"
            c_var: "{F_string_result_as_arg}"


.. code-block:: yaml

    name: f_mixin_one
    f_pre_call:
    - "! comment f_mixin_one"

    name: f_mixin_two
    mixin:
    - f_mixin_one
    f_pre_call:
    - "! comment f_mixin_two"    # appends

    name: f_function_one
    mixin:
    - f_mixin_one
    f_pre_call:
    - "! comment two"            # replaces
   

Passing function result as an argument
--------------------------------------

This section explains how statements are used to generate code for
functions which return a struct.

Compiler ABI do not agree on how some function results should be
returned.  To ensure portablity, some function results must be passed
as an additional argument.  This is typically more complicated types
such as struct or complex.

   :end-before: end function_struct_scalar
