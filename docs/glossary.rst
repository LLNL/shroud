Glossary
========

bufferify

    The process of creating a buffer.
    The c wrapper will may create an additional function for each wrapped function.
    This function has additional arguments needed for the Fortran interface
    to pass the size of an argument.

c wrapper

    The wrapper with a C API.
    When wrapping C++, the C wrapper will be C++ code but functions will use
    ``extern "C"`` block to allow them to be called from C and Fortran using
    the ``bind(C)`` keyword.

capsule

   Holds a pointer to a C++ class instance and some
   memory management flags.
   The name was inspired by the Python PyCapsule type.

fortran wrapper

   Fortran functions which call the C wrapper functions.

library

   A collection of C++ declarations wrapped at the same time.
   This creates a Fortran or Python module.

native type

   Integer or real of any size.

shadow class

   A Fortran derived type which contains a capsule and type-bound
   functions to provide a Fortran object-oriented interface similar to
   a C++ class.
   Similar to a `PyObject` struct in Python.

splicer

   A block of code which implements the wrapper.  It is generated by
   Shroud but can be replaced with a user provided implementation.  A
   splicer also provides a place to insert code into a generated file
   a well defined places.  This allows user provided code to be
   preserved when regenerating wrappers.
