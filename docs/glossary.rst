Glossary
========

bufferify

    The process of creating a buffer.
    The C wrapper may create an additional function for each wrapped function.
    This function has additional arguments needed for the Fortran interface
    to pass the metadata of the argument such as the size.

C wrapper

    The wrapper with a C API.
    When wrapping C++, the C wrapper will be C++ code but functions will use
    ``extern "C"`` block to allow them to be called from C and Fortran using
    the ``bind(C)`` keyword.

capsule

   Struct to hold a pointer to a C++ class instance and some
   memory management flags.
   The name was inspired by the Python ``PyCapsule`` type.

cdesc

   Struct used to contain information used to describe memory.
   The address, type, shape, element size.
   Similar to ``CFI_desc_t`` from Fortran's
   *Further Interoperability with C*.

CFI

   C Fortran Interface defined by the *Further interoperability of Fortran with C*
   features of TS29113 and Fortran 2018.

flatten

   The process of converting a nested name such as ``namespace::class::method``
   into a name acceptable to Fortran and C such as ``namespace_class_method``.
   
Fortran wrapper

   Fortran functions which call the C wrapper functions.

helper function

   A function used by Shroud to factor out common functionality from wrappers.
   
library

   A collection of C++ declarations wrapped at the same time.
   This creates a Fortran or Python module.

name mangling

    A technique used to solve various problems caused by the need to
    resolve unique names for programming entities in many modern
    programming languages.  -- wikipedia

    Shroud creates unique name for C++ namespaced, overloaded and
    templated function by adding additional components to the C and
    Fortran names to make them unique.

native type

   numeric type, intrinsic.
   Integer or real of any size.

POD

   Plain Old Data.

shadow class

   A Fortran derived type which contains a capsule and type-bound
   procedures to provide a Fortran object-oriented interface similar to
   a C++ class.
   Also known as a proxy class.
   Similar to a `PyObject` struct in Python.

splicer

   A block of code which implements the wrapper.  It is generated by
   Shroud but can be replaced with a user provided implementation.  A
   splicer also provides a place to insert code into a generated file
   a well defined places.  This allows user provided code to be
   preserved when regenerating wrappers.

statements

   A data structure used to describe how a function argument will be
   wrapped. Described in :ref:`StatementsAnchor` chapter.
   
typemap

   A data structure used to describe how to wrap a C/C++ type.
   Described in :ref:`TypemapsAnchor` chapter.
