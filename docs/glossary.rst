Glossary
========

bufferify

    The process of creating a buffer.
    The C wrapper may create an additional function for each wrapped function.
    This function has additional arguments needed for the Fortran interface
    to pass the metadata of the argument such as the size.

C wrapper

    The wrapper with a C API.
    When wrapping C++, the C wrapper will be C++ code but functions will use
    ``extern "C"`` block to allow them to be called from C and Fortran using
    the ``bind(C)`` keyword.

capsule

   Holds a pointer to a C++ class instance and some
   memory management flags.
   The name was inspired by the Python ``PyCapsule`` type.

Fortran wrapper

   Fortran functions which call the C wrapper functions.

library

   A collection of C++ declarations wrapped at the same time.
   This creates a Fortran or Python module.

native type

   Integer or real of any size.

shadow class

   A Fortran derived type which contains a capsule and type-bound
   functions to provide a Fortran object-oriented interface similar to
   a C++ class.
   Similar to a `PyObject` struct in Python.

splicer

   A block of code which implements the wrapper.  It is generated by
   Shroud but can be replaced with a user provided implementation.  A
   splicer also provides a place to insert code into a generated file
   a well defined places.  This allows user provided code to be
   preserved when regenerating wrappers.
