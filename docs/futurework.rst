Future Work
===========

  * complex

  * pointers to pointers and in particular ``char **`` are not supported.
    An argument like ``Class **ptr+intent(out)`` does not work.
    Instead use a function which return a pointer to ``Class *``

  * reference counting and garbage collection

  * Support for *Further Interoperability of Fortran with C*.
    This includes the ISO_Fortran_binding.h header file.


The copying of strings solves the blank-filled vs null-terminated
differences between Fortran and C and works well for many strings.
However, if a large buffer is passed, it may be desirable to avoid the
copy.

There is some initial work to support Python and Lua wrappers.


Possible Future Work
--------------------

Use a tool to parse C++ and extract info.
